# MOVIES-ETL

## Overview
I will create a pipeline that Extract, Transform and Load teh data into existing tables. I will create one function that takes in the three files: movies_metadata, ratings, and wikipedia_movies. After that, I will perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
